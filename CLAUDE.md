# RC Vibe GP (Godot 4.8, GDScript)

## Godot executable

Portable install, not on PATH:

- `D:\Godot\Godot_v4.8-dev6_win64_console.exe`: use this one from the shell, because it prints to stdout/stderr
- `D:\Godot\Godot_v4.8-dev6_win64.exe`: GUI editor

## Levels are generated, not hand-edited

Each level in `levels/*Level.tscn` (plus its meshes in `generated/*.res`) is written by a generator script
in the project root: `regenerate_<level>.gd`, run through the matching `regenerate_<level>.tscn`.
Don't edit the generated `.tscn`/`.res` files by hand, because the next regeneration overwrites them.
Change the generator and regenerate instead.

Regenerate headless from the project root (the scene saves the level and quits by itself):

```sh
"/d/Godot/Godot_v4.8-dev6_win64_console.exe" --headless --path . res://regenerate_frostpeak_creek.tscn
```

Afterwards, check the output for `ERROR:` lines from the generator. Generators like Frostpeak Creek run
self-checks (`_verify_ramp_junction`, `_verify_bridge_alignment`) that `push_error` on bad geometry but
still save the level. You can ignore these at exit: "Node not found: Players/PlayerSpawner" (`Level.gd` runs
outside a game), "Leaked instance dependency", and RID/ObjectDB leak messages.

`Level.tscn` and `MountainLevel.tscn` can each be written by several generators (`regenerate_both`,
`regenerate_custom_path`, `regenerate_desert`, ...). Don't regenerate them unless you know which one made the
current file.

## Frostpeak Creek road joints

- Surfaces that meet are built to shared heights above their centrelines: trunk collision deck +0.08
  (`TRUNK_DECK_Y`), shortcut deck +0.05 (`SHORTCUT_DECK_Y`), timber bridge deck top +0.08 above the bridge
  origin (`BRIDGE_DECK_TOP`). Change one and the joints step.
- The shortcut curves are built *before* `generate_world()`. TerrainGenerator then lowers terrain under
  them (`extra_road_curves`) and opens the trunk curb where a shortcut deck crosses it (`junction_openings`,
  computed from the deck footprint, not hand-entered).
- Trunk control-point handles are made collinear after the curve is built, except at the jump lips and
  landings. A non-collinear pair is a corner in the road, and the road ribbon folds on its inside.

## Curbs

`curb_stripes.gdshader` draws the red/white kerb only where the curb mesh's vertex colour red channel is
1 (corners), and a plain shoulder with a white edge line elsewhere. TerrainGenerator writes that weight
(`_apply_curb_corner_weights`) when it builds the curbs. To update the saved curb meshes of every level
without regenerating them, run `res://refresh_curb_corners.tscn` headless.

## Snow drifts

`SnowDrift.gd` is a height field laid over road rows (`row_centres`/`row_rights`, set by the generator).
Cars ride on its packed layer and carve the loose powder at runtime. The mesh and packed collider are
internal children rebuilt on load, so the level file only stores the row data. PlayerCart reads
`snow_depth_at()` at its nose for drag and the speed cap (`snow_plough_depth`).

## Procedural mesh winding

Godot front faces wind **clockwise**, and `generate_normals()` gives a face normal of `(c - a) x (b - a)`.
If you check winding with the right-handed `(b - a) x (c - a)`, the mesh comes out inside-out: near
faces get culled and you see the far faces from the inside. To confirm, render it or compare against
`generate_normals()`.

## Headless gotchas

- The generator runs on the dummy renderer, which ignores `MultiMesh.set_instance_transform()`/
  `set_instance_color()`. Those instances are saved with no transforms and stay invisible. Write
  `MultiMesh.buffer` directly instead (see the icicles in `regenerate_frostpeak_creek.gd`).
- Headless can't render screenshots. To look at a level, run a `SceneTree` script (`-s`) with the
  windowed console exe and `--resolution 1600x900`, place a `Camera3D`, and save
  `root.get_texture().get_image()`.
